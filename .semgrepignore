# Known acceptable patterns (with justification)
# - nyx-core/src/sandbox.rs: temp_dir used for isolated test environments
# - nyx-daemon/src/pure_rust_dht.rs: SHA1 required for DHT compatibility with libp2p
# - nyx-daemon/src/main.rs: args parsing is standard CLI pattern

# Specific files with justified usage
nyx-daemon/src/low_power.rs  # unsafe required for power state FFI
