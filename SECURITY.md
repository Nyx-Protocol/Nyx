# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

- **Please report vulnerabilities privately** via GitHub Security Advisories
- **Do not open public issues** for security reports
- **Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly** until they are fixed
- We aim to acknowledge reports within 24 hours and provide a timeline for fixes
- **Critical vulnerabilities** will be addressed within 48 hours
- **High-severity issues** will be patched within 7 days

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Latest main branch | ✅ | Full security support |
| Pre-release versions | ⚠️ | Limited support |
| All others | ❌ | Upgrade required |

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Design Principles
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Secure by Default**: Conservative default configurations
- **Fail Securely**: Graceful degradation under attack

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM (Kyber) NIST-standardized algorithms
- **AEAD Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption with associated data
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: HKDF-based key derivation ensures past communications remain secure
- **Anti-Replay Protection**: Temporal and sequence-based replay attack prevention
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic cryptographic key rotation with configurable intervals
- **Secure Random**: Hardware-backed entropy sources for all cryptographic operations

### Network Security
- **Traffic Analysis Resistance**: Adaptive cover traffic and sophisticated padding schemes
- **Metadata Protection**: Header obfuscation and timing randomization
- **Connection Security**: Noise Protocol Framework providing TLS 1.3+ equivalent security
- **Path Diversity**: Multiple transport paths to prevent single points of failure
- **Rate Limiting**: Sophisticated DDoS protection and traffic shaping
- **Authenticated Encryption**: All network communications are authenticated and encrypted

### Implementation Security
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free, and double-free vulnerabilities
- **Zero Unsafe Code**: Complete avoidance of unsafe Rust code across the entire codebase
- **Constant-Time Cryptography**: All cryptographic operations use constant-time algorithms to prevent timing attacks
- **Secure Memory Management**: Sensitive data is zeroized immediately after use using compiler-enforced techniques
- **Stack Protection**: Compiler-enforced stack canaries and control flow integrity
- **ASLR/PIE**: Position-independent executables with address space layout randomization
- **Sandboxing**: Plugin system isolation using OS-level sandboxing (seccomp, capabilities, job objects)

### Supply Chain Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduced attack surface through careful dependency selection
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process for verification
- **Code Signing**: All releases are cryptographically signed
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for transparency

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- **Static Analysis**: Clippy with security-focused lints
- **Dependency Auditing**: `cargo audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- **Fuzz Testing**: Continuous fuzzing of critical parsing and cryptographic code
- **Property-Based Testing**: Formal verification of security properties
- **Coverage Analysis**: Security-critical code paths have 100% test coverage

### Manual Security Review
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat model updates and reviews
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review process
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular external security assessments
- **Cryptographic Review**: Expert review of all cryptographic implementations

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- **Always use the latest stable Rust compiler** with all security patches
- **Enable security compiler flags**: `-Z sanitizer=address`, `-Z sanitizer=memory`
- **Review code for timing attacks** and side-channel vulnerabilities
- **Implement proper error handling** without information leakage
- **Use security-focused development practices**: secure coding guidelines, threat modeling
- **Validate all inputs** at trust boundaries
- **Follow principle of least privilege** in all system interactions

### For Operators
- **Network Security**: Run Nyx behind a firewall with proper network segmentation
- **Authentication**: Use strong, randomly generated authentication tokens (minimum 256-bit entropy)
- **System Updates**: Keep all systems updated with latest security patches
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for suspicious activity
- **TLS Termination**: Use TLS termination proxies when exposing services
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate resource limits to prevent DoS attacks
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt all backups and store them securely
## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Remote code execution, data breaches, cryptographic failures
- **High**: Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, significant DoS
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, limited DoS, configuration issues
- **Low**: Minor information leakage, documentation issues

### Response Timeline
- **Critical**: 2 hours acknowledgment, 24 hours initial response, 72 hours patch
- **High**: 4 hours acknowledgment, 72 hours initial response, 7 days patch
- **Medium**: 24 hours acknowledgment, 7 days initial response, 30 days patch
- **Low**: 72 hours acknowledgment, 30 days response
