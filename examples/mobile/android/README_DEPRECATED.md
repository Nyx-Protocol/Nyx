# Android Integration (Deprecated)

**Note**: This directory contains legacy integration examples. 

**NEW**: Please see the comprehensive integration guide at `../android_integration.md` for:

- Complete C ABI setup with CMake
- Native JNI implementation examples  
- Power policy integration with screen off ratio tracking
- Full MainActivity example with lifecycle handling

The new guide uses the stable C ABI (`nyx_mobile_ffi.h`) instead of deprecated Java-level JNI stubs.
