//! Nyx SDK (minimal skeleton)
//! - Error and Result types
//! - Lightweight in-process stream abstraction for apps
//! - Basic daemon IPC client (JSON over Unix socket / Windows named pipe)
//!
//! NOTE: This is a lean, dependency-friendly surface to allow the workspace to
//! build. It can be extended progressively to integrate with nyx-stream/core.
