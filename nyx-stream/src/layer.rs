//! Layer abstraction placeholder.
//! This file intentionally left minimal as a future insertion point for a
//! consolidated layering diagram & high-level trait definitions that bridge
//! stream framing, multipath scheduling, padding, and plugin dispatch.
//!
//! Rationale:
//! - Keeps public API surface stable while higher-level orchestration evolves.
//! - Avoids scattering architecture comments across many modules.
//! - Provides a canonical location to document cross-layer invariants:
//!   * Each outbound frame passes: Frame -> (Padding) -> (Replay Check) -> (Multipath Scheduler)
//!   * Rekey events must flush pending HPKE rekey queue before new frames are enqueued.
//!   * Anti-replay windows are updated strictly after successful decryption.
//!
//! NOTE: When substantial logic is added, ensure new items are re-exported from lib.rs
//! with clear grouping comments for maintainability.

// (No code yet; acts as architectural anchor.)
